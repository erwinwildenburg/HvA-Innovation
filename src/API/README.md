Build the API on Windows for .NET Core
======================================

This guide will walk you through building PowerShell on Windows, targeting .NET Core. 
We'll start by showing how to set up your environment from scratch.

Environment
===========
These instructions are tested on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2012
R2, though they should work anywhere the dependencies work.

Git Setup
---------

Using Git requires it to be setup correctly; refer to the
[README](../../README.md)

This guide assumes that you have recursively cloned the MSPTools repository and `cd`ed into it.

Visual Studio
-------------

You will need to install an edition of Visual Studio 2015 (Community, Enterprise, or Professional). 
The free Community edition of Visual Studio 2015 can be downloaded [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/visual-studio-community-vs/).
